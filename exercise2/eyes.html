	<h2>Rick Starkweather</h2>
	<p>"Over the years I've slain by gallons every day and yet the time has come that every victem tastes just the same.  I used to think that every killing was a treat, but I was wrong, for I was young.  I let them suffer, let them bleed."</p>
	<h2>Trey Howard</h2>
	<p>"I bless the rains down in Africa..."</p>

	<h2>Freddy Okito</h2>
	<p> "Its a marathon not a sprint but I still gotta win the race."
	
	<h2>Jesse Sherb</h2>
